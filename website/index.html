			  <h1>What is Koji (糀)?</h1>
			  <img id="koji-pic" src="img/koji.jpg">
			  <p>Koji is steamed rice that has been inoculated with koji spores (Aspergillus orzyae) and incubated to allow the fungus to grow.  Rich in enzymes, koji is the key ingredient in all the basic foods of the traditional Japanese diet.  It is used as a starter to make miso, soy sauce, sake, shochu, mirin and vinegar.
			  </p>
			  <p>It is produced from a traditional and natural fermentation process. It contains enzymes to break down proteins to produce amino acids including glutamate.
			  </p>
			  <p>It also adds "umami" punch to vegetables and fish and tenderizes meat. It helps to reduce the use of salt, sugar and fat.</p>
